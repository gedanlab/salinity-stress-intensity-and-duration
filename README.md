Plant response in a greenhouse salinity stress manipulative experiment 

Experiments conducted on 10 plant species in the Harlan Greenhouse at George Washington University in summer 2021. Plants were germinanted in benign conditions and exposed to salinity through bottom watering. The watering regime controlled the duration of exposure and the source water controlled the intensity of stress exposure. 

Glycophytes were exposed to 0, 1, 2, 4, or 6 ppt salinity over 0, 5, 10, or 20 day pulses or a constant press (30 days per month). Halophytes were exposed to 0, 6, 12, or 24 ppt salinity over 0, 5, 15 day pulses or a constant press (30 days per month).

A publication details experimental methods, analysis, and visualization of data. We will update this README with a citation and link to the publication when it becomes available.
